#####################################

Overview
********

Shell application with networking support with openthread and BLE shell commands.

Requirements
************

- Alif Balletto Development Kit

Optinally can also be used with Alif Ensemble Development Kit without BLE/15.4 connectivity

Automatically starting the OpenThread
*************************************

Enable automatic start of the OpenThread stack

.. code-block:: console

   west build alif/applications/testapp -- -DCONFIG_OPENTHREAD_MANUAL_START=n

Including the EthosU shell commands
***********************************

To build the sample, you first need to pull in the optional dependencies by running the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   west config manifest.group-filter -- +optional

   ot dataset init new
   ot dataset channel 11
   ot dataset networkkey 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
   ot dataset panid 0x1234
   ot dataset meshlocalprefix fd11:22:: /64
   ot dataset activetimestamp 221212
   ot dataset networkname OpenThreadDemo
   ot dataset commit active

OpenThread Sleepy end device evaluate
