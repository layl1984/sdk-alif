Alif Power Management States Demo
##################################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates Zephyr power management states on Alif RTSS cores, showcasing
different PM state transitions with RTC wakeup capabilities. The sample illustrates:

* **PM_STATE_RUNTIME_IDLE**: Light sleep state with quick wakeup
* **PM_STATE_SUSPEND_TO_RAM (S2RAM)**: Deep sleep with retention (HE core only)

  * Substate 0 (STANDBY): Medium power savings
  * Substate 1 (STOP): Higher power savings

* **PM_STATE_SOFT_OFF**: Deepest sleep, no retention, full system reset on wakeup

The behavior differs between HP and HE cores:

**HE Core (with retention support)**:

* When booting from **TCM** (VTOR = 0x0):

  * Demonstrates RUNTIME_IDLE, S2RAM STANDBY, S2RAM STOP
  * Skips SOFT_OFF (uses retention instead)
  * Resumes execution after each state

* When booting from **MRAM** (VTOR >= 0x80000000):

  * Demonstrates RUNTIME_IDLE, SOFT_OFF
  * System resets and restarts from main() after SOFT_OFF

**HP Core (no retention support)**:

* Only SOFT_OFF is available (no S2RAM support)
* Demonstrates RUNTIME_IDLE, then SOFT_OFF
* System resets and restarts from main() after SOFT_OFF

************

* Alif Ensemble or Balletto development board
* RTC peripheral enabled for wakeup

Building and Running
********************

Build for HE core (TCM boot with retention):

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p auto -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_he \
       ../alif/samples/drivers/pm/system_off \
       -S pm-system-off-he \
       -DCONFIG_FLASH_BASE_ADDRESS=0x0 \
       -DCONFIG_FLASH_LOAD_OFFSET=0x0 \
       -DCONFIG_FLASH_SIZE=256

Build for HE core (MRAM boot):

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p auto -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_he \
       ../alif/samples/drivers/pm/system_off \
       -S pm-system-off-he

Build for HP core:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -p auto -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_hp \
       ../alif/samples/drivers/pm/system_off \
       -S pm-system-off-hp

Flash the binary using SE Tools. See :ref:`programming_an_application` for details.

Notes
*****

* **Debugger**: Disconnect debugger before testing - it prevents cores from entering OFF states
* **UART Hub**: If using USB hub for UART, set BOOT_DELAY to avoid missing logs after power cycle
* **Sleep Durations**:

  * RUNTIME_IDLE: 18 seconds
  * S2RAM STANDBY: 20 seconds
  * S2RAM STOP: 22 seconds
  * SOFT_OFF: 24 seconds

* **CONFIG_POWEROFF**: Alternative mode to test sys_poweroff() instead of PM state sequence
* **Retention Memory**: HE core retains SERAM and optionally TCM (when booting from TCM)
* **Power Measurement**: For accurate power measurements, ensure all unused peripherals are disabled
