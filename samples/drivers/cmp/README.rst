CMP Sample
==========

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates the usage of the Alif CMP driver.

Building and Running
********************

The application will build only for a target that has a devicetree entry with
:dt:`alif,cmp` as a compatible.
In this example below the :ref:`alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_he` board is used.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/drivers/cmp
   :board: alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_he
   :goals: build
   :gen-args: -S alif-cmp

.. note::

   - This sample application demonstrates the **cmp0** functionality. To use **lpcmp**, enable the respective devicetree property.
   - On boards such as **alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp**, the **cmp2** and **cmp3** pins are connected to **uart2** pins. Before building, update.
     the configuration to use **uart4** instead of **uart2**.
   - **LPCMP functionality is supported** on `alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp` and `alif_e7_dk_rtss_he` but no output pinouts available on board.
