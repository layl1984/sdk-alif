config AURACAST_STREAM_NAME
	string "LE audio broadcast name"
	default "ALIF_LE_AUDIO"

config AURACAST_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD
	string "LE audio broadcast password"
	default "passwordpassword"
	help
	  If defined the broadcast stream will be encrypted.
	  Length needs to be between 4 and 16 chars or empty string (default) to disable.

config LE_AUDIO_PRESENTATION_DELAY_MS
	int "Presentation delay in ms"
	default 40
	help
	  LE audio presentation delay in ms. For the audio source use-case, this is defined as the
	  time in ms from the start of recording an audio frame, to the SDU reference anchor point
	  at which the SDU containing the same audio frame is sent over BLE. The absolute minimum
	  possible presentation delay would be the frame length (10 ms) plus the encoding time of
	  the frame, since it is impossible to send the frame before it has been fully recorded and
	  encoded. But some margin should be added on top of this to account for any overhead and
	  timing variations due to other activities of the software occurring while recording and
	  encoding the audio.

config APP_PRINT_STATS
	bool "Print audio SDU counter information"
	depends on LOG
	help
	  Helps to debug audio processing in some simple cases. Just a free running counter of sent
	  audio SDUs is printed at regular intervals.

config APP_PRINT_STATS_INTERVAL
	int "Interval for printing info about send frames, in SDU count"
	default 1024
	depends on APP_PRINT_STATS
	help
	  Interval at which to print presentation delay statistics. The interval is measured in SDU
	  count, e.g. 1024 means to print the statistics every 512 SDUs (per channel). With a 10 ms
	  SDU interval this is around 10 seconds.

config MICROPHONE_GAIN
	int "Microphone gain in percentage"
	default 800
	range 100 1000

config INPUT_VOLUME_LEVEL
	int "Input volume level in percentage when MIC input is active"
	default 33
	range 10 100
