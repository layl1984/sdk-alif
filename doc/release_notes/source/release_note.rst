Breaking Changes
----------------

- **Balletto B1 Hardware Support**:
  This release supports only Balletto B1 revA6 or newer. Earlier revisions are not supported.

- **BLE ROM Version Configuration**:
  BLE ROM version is now hardware-specific and defined in device tree. Support for BLE ROM v1.0 has been removed. Only BLE ROM v1.2 is supported. The ROM version is automatically detected from hardware and cannot be manually configured by users.

Known Issues
------------

- **BLE** le_periph_pm application has a RTC related issue which causes M55 RTC alarms to stop working randomly
- **BLE** audio Unicast initiator fails to open 2nd channel when using Ceva host stack
- **BLE** Auracast sink does not receive an encryption key sent by Auracast assistant when using Ceva host stack
- **BLE** Connection param update does not work with Ceva host stack, works fine with Zephyr host stack.
- SPI1 DMA operations exhibit inconsistent behavior.
