MIPI Camera

Introduction
============

This document explains how to create, compile, and run a demo application for the MIPI Camera interface provided by Alif Semiconductor™ and integrated into Ensemble™ devices.

Overview
--------

The MIPI camera is utilized for transmitting pixel data in a serial format. The camera sensor (ARX3A0) transmits pixel data to the DPHY-RX, which transfers it through the PHY Protocol Interface (PPI) to the MIPI CSI2 host. MIPI CSI2 unpacks the pixel data and forwards it through the Image Pixel Interface (IPI). The Camera Pixel Interface (CPI) receives the pixel data from IPI and stores it in memory via the AXI bus.

Hardware Requirements and Setup
===============================

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

- **Alif Ensemble DevKit (B0 Flat Board, E7)**
- **ARX3A0 Camera Sensor (IAS1MOD-ARX3A0CSSC090110-GEVB)**
- Support on E7 only.

CPI (Camera Parallel Interface)
-------------------------------

The CPI IP, provided by Alif Semiconductor, captures frames and stores them in the allocated memory area, facilitating efficient data transfer between the camera sensor and memory.

I2C Controller
--------------

The I2C IP enables communication between the system-on-chip (SoC) and the ARX3A0 Camera Sensor.

MIPI DPHY
---------

The MIPI DPHY Physical layer receives serial input data from the camera sensor and transfers it to the MIPI CSI2 host. Key features include:

- Flexible clock configuration: 17 MHz to 52 MHz.
- Lane Operation: Data rates from 80 Mbps to 2.5 Gbps per lane in the forward direction.
- Aggregate throughput: Up to 10 Gbps with four data lanes in the forward direction.
- Maximum low-power (LP) data rate: 10 Mbps.
- PHY-Protocol Interface (PPI): Used for clock and data lanes.
- Low-power Modes: Supports low power escape modes and Ultra Low Power state.
- HS TX and RX Features: Programmable HS TX amplitude levels, automatic de-skew calibration, equalization, and offset cancellation.
- Internal Pattern Checker for testing and verification.

MIPI CSI2
---------

MIPI CSI2 unpacks serial input data based on the configured pixel data type, conveying pixels and generating timed video synchronization signals via the Image Pixel Interface (IPI). Notable features include:

- Combo PHY Support: Utilizes four RX data lanes on D-PHY.
- High Data Rate: Up to 2.5 Gbps per lane in D-PHY.
- Data Format Flexibility: Supports YUV, RGB, RAW, and user-defined byte-based data.
- Error Detection and Correction: Robust mechanisms at PHY, packet, line, and frame levels.

ARX3A0 Camera Sensor
--------------------

The ARX3A0 camera sensor, with a 1/10th-inch optical format, is compact and energy-efficient, ideal for IoT devices. It features:

- Active resolution: 560 x 560 pixels.
- Frame rate: Up to 360 frames per second.

Required Configuration Features
===============================

- ``CONFIG_VIDEO=y``
- ``CONFIG_VIDEO_MIPI_CSI2_DW=y``
- ``CONFIG_LOG=y``
- ``CONFIG_PRINTK=y``
- ``CONFIG_STDOUT_CONSOLE=y``
- ``CONFIG_I2C_TARGET=y``
- ``CONFIG_I2C=y``
- ``CONFIG_I2C_DW_CLOCK_SPEED=100``
- ``CONFIG_MT9M114_PARALLEL_INIT=n``
- ``CONFIG_FB_USES_DTCM_REGION=n`` (needed for E7)

Software Requirements
=====================

To run the MIPI camera application, the following software components and drivers are required:

1. **Camera Drivers (MIPI Interface)**:
   - Alif Zephyr MIPI CSI2 Driver
   - Alif Zephyr Video Driver
   - Alif Zephyr MIPI DSI Driver
   - Alif Zephyr MIPI DPHY Driver
2. **ARX3A0 Camera Sensor Driver**:
   - Zephyr I2C DesignWare Driver
   - Alif Zephyr ARX3A0 Camera Sensor Driver

Selected ARX3A0 Camera Sensor Configurations
============================================

- **Interface**: MIPI CSI2
- **Resolution**: 560x560
- **Output Format**: RAW Bayer10

Exporting and Converting Captured Images
========================================

After capturing images, users must export the raw image data to convert it into a viewable format (e.g., RGB). The raw image data is stored in the capture buffers as shown in the console output. To export the raw image data, use the file paths provided in the console output (e.g., ``/home/$USER/path/capture_0.bin``) and transfer them to a system where image conversion can be performed.

Image Conversion from Bayer to RGB
----------------------------------

To convert a Bayer 10 image to RGB format for viewing, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   bayer2rgb -i image_file.bin -o checking_rgb.tiff -w 560 -v 560 -b 8 -f GRBG -m SIMPLE -t

Building an MIPI Camera Application with Zephyr
================================================

Follow these steps to build the MIPI camera application using the Alif Zephyr SDK:

1. For instructions on fetching the Alif Zephyr SDK and navigating to the Zephyr repository, please refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_

.. note::
   The build commands shown here are specifically for the Alif E7 DevKit.
   To build the application for other boards, modify the board name in the build command accordingly. For more information, refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_, under the section Setting Up and Building Zephyr Applications.

2. Build commands for applications on the M55 HP core:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_hp ../alif/samples/drivers/video/ -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=../alif/samples/drivers/video/boards/serial_camera_arx3a0.overlay -p always

Executing Binary on the DevKit
==============================================

To execute binaries on the DevKit follow the command

.. code-block:: bash

   west flash
