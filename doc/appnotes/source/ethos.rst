Ethos NPU U-55/U85
===================

Introduction
=============

Alif Semiconductor’s Ensemble and Balletto families feature flexible compute architectures that integrate Arm® Cortex®-A32 application processors, Cortex-M55 real-time processors with Armv8.1-M architecture and Helium™ MVE (M-Profile Vector Extension), and Arm Ethos™ microNPUs for accelerated machine learning (ML) inference. All Ensemble and Balletto devices combine the Cortex-M55 with an Ethos-U55 microNPU, while the higher-end Ensemble E4 and E8 variants further incorporate an Ethos-U85 microNPU to enable efficient acceleration of transformer-based neural networks (TNNs).

This application note offers practical guidance for developing ML inference applications on Ensemble and Balletto devices using the Zephyr RTOS and the TensorFlow Lite Micro (TFLM) framework. It presents two reference applications: tflm_ethosu, which supports convolutional neural network (CNN) models on all devices equipped with Ethos-U55 or Ethos-U85 microNPUs, and tflm_transformer, designed specifically for deploying compact transformer models such as BERT-Tiny on platforms featuring the Ethos-U85. The document serves as a concise, implementation-focused guide to harnessing hardware-accelerated ML across Alif’s microcontroller portfolio.

The Real-Time Processor cores are:

- **High-Performance Arm Cortex-M55 (RTSS-HP)**: Operating at up to 400 MHz.
- **High-Efficiency Arm Cortex-M55 (RTSS-HE)**: Operating at up to 160 MHz.

.. note:: Please refer to Arm Ethos-U55 documentation for more information.

Setup
=====

The Alif Zephyr release supports building the ``tflm_ethosu`` Zephyr application for both the HE and HP M55 cores of the SoC. This application runs a model compiled using the Vela compiler. The model is integrated into the application as a C array and loaded into the Ethos NPU. The application verifies that the Ethos NPU (128 MACs for the HE M55 core and 256 MACs for the HP M55 core) is properly loaded and functioning.

Building an Ethos Application with Zephyr
==========================================

Follow these steps to build the Ethos application using the Alif Zephyr SDK:

1. For instructions on fetching the Alif Zephyr SDK and navigating to the Zephyr repository, please refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_

.. note::
   The build commands shown here are specifically for the Alif E8 DevKit.
   To build the application for other boards, modify the board name in the build command accordingly. For more information, refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_, under the section Setting Up and Building Zephyr Applications.

2. Build commands for applications on the Ethos-U85-256 HE core:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -b alif_e8_dk/ae822fa0e5597xx0/rtss_he ../alif/samples/modules/tflite-micro/tflm_ethosu/ -p always -- -DETHOSU_TARGET_NPU_CONFIG=ethos-u85-256 -DEXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE="boards/enable_ethosu85.overlay" -G"Unix Makefiles"\'

3. Build commands for applications on the Ethos-U85-256 HP core:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -b alif_e8_dk/ae822fa0e5597xx0/rtss_hp ../alif/samples/modules/tflite-micro/tflm_ethosu/ -p always -- -DETHOSU_TARGET_NPU_CONFIG=ethos-u85-256 -DEXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE="boards/enable_ethosu85.overlay" -G"Unix Makefiles"\'

4. Build commands for applications on the Ethos-U55-256 HE core:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -b alif_e8_dk/ae822fa0e5597xx0/rtss_he ../alif/samples/modules/tflite-micro/tflm_ethosu/ -p always -- -DETHOSU_TARGET_NPU_CONFIG=ethos-u55-128 -DEXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE="boards/enable_ethosu55.overlay" -G"Unix Makefiles"\'

5. Build commands for applications on the Ethos-U55-256 HP core:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -b alif_e8_dk/ae822fa0e5597xx0/rtss_hp ../alif/samples/modules/tflite-micro/tflm_ethosu/ -p always -- -DETHOSU_TARGET_NPU_CONFIG=ethos-u55-256 -DEXTRA_DTC_OVERLAY_FILE="boards/enable_ethosu55.overlay" -G"Unix Makefiles"\'

Alternatively, use the Ninja tool:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -b alif_e7_dk_rtss_he samples/modules/tflite-micro/tflm_ethosu/
   west build -b alif_e7_dk_rtss_hp samples/modules/tflite-micro/tflm_ethosu/

How to Use the Application
==========================

This sample application can be used for basic inferencing of input data on the Ethos subsystem using a TFLite model in the M55 core of the Alif Ensemble devkit. It utilizes the Ethos U-55 for accelerating supported network operators and the M55 for unsupported operators using appropriate reference kernels.

Limitations/Known Issues
========================

- Compilation of the Ethos-U application has not been tried with the ArmClang and open-source clang compilers.

Loading the Binary on the Alif Ensemble Devkit
==============================================

To flash and execute the binary on the DevKit using the SE tool:

1. Copy the generated binary (e.g., `zephyr_e7_rtsshe_ethosu.bin` or `zephyr_e7_rtsshp_ethosu.bin`) and the corresponding JSON configuration file to the SE tool directory.
2. Use the SE tool to flash the binary to MRAM or TCM. Execute the flashing commands as per the Alif documentation (e.g., similar to `python3 app-gen-toc.py` and `python3 app-write-mram.py`).
3. Ensure the debugger is disconnected to allow the core to enter the OFF state.
4. Reset the DevKit to boot the cores and run the application.
