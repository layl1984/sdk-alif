OSPI Flash
==========

Introduction
============

The Alif DevKit features a 32MB ISSI Flash (IS25WX256) connected to the Octal SPI 1 (OSPI1) controller. This application note describes how to read from and write to the flash using the Alif Semiconductor Zephyr SDK. The flash driver implements Zephyr's standard flash APIs for erasing, reading, and writing to the flash.

Application Description
=======================

This document covers the demo application for the Alif DevKit:

**Flash Demo Application**: Demonstrates the Zephyr Standard Flash API implementation on the Alif DevKit.

.. note::
   For more details, refer to the `Zephyr Flash API Reference <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/peripherals/flash.html>`_.

Hardware Connections
--------------------

The ISSI Flash is connected to the DevKit via the OSPI1 interface. No additional connections are required.

Building OSPI Flash Application in Zephyr
============================================

Follow these steps to build the Zephyr-based OSPI Flash application using the GCC compiler and the Alif Zephyr SDK:

1. For instructions on fetching the Alif Zephyr SDK and navigating to the Zephyr repository, please refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_

.. note::
   The build commands shown here are specifically for the Alif E7 DevKit.
   To build the application for other boards, modify the board name in the build command accordingly. For more information, refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_, under the section Setting Up and Building Zephyr Applications.


2. Build commands for applications on the M55 HE core:

.. code-block:: bash

      west build -p always -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_he ../alif/samples/drivers/spi_flash

3. Build commands for applications on the M55 HP core:

.. code-block:: bash

      west build -p always -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_hp ../alif/samples/drivers/spi_flash


Once the build command completes successfully, executable images will be generated and placed in the `build/zephyr` directory. Both `.bin` (binary) and `.elf` (Executable and Linkable Format) files will be available.

Executing Binary on the DevKit
===============================

To execute binaries on the DevKit follow the command

.. code-block:: bash

   west flash
