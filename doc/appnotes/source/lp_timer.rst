LP Timer
===============

Introduction
============

The 32-bit Low-Power Timer (LPTIMER) module counts down from a programmed value and generates an interrupt when the count reaches zero. Two events can cause the timer to load the initial value from which it counts down. The first event is when the timer is enabled after being reset or disabled, and the second event is when the timer count reaches zero.

The device includes up to four LPTIMER modules. Each LPTIMER module supports the following main features:

- 32-bit width of the timer counter register
- User-defined count mode of operation
- Asynchronous event counting
- Individual interrupt output
- Independent clock input that can be connected either to internal clocks or to an external clock source
- Each odd-numbered LPTIMER module can be concatenated with the previous even-numbered LPTIMER module to form up to a 64-bit timer.

Description
============

The LPTIMER IP, sourced from Synopsys DesignWare, can be utilized as a timer driver within the counter driver subsystem for the LPTIMER module. It supports a 32KHz clock and an external clock input, both of which are hardware-specific features. Additionally, the code includes support for a 128KHz clock, although stability issues exist with this source due to hardware limitations. Currently, cascaded input is only partially supported, and the output toggle feature is available for all channels.

Furthermore, the LPTIMER is integrated into the Alarm application as a demo application, where it functions as expected. The same demo app is also utilized by the RTC (Real-Time Clock) and UTIMER. To facilitate configuration, separate overlay and config files for the RTC, UTIMER, and LPTIMER reside in the board’s directory of the Alarm application. Users can select these files using the west build command.

Building an LP TIMER Application with Zephyr
==============================================

Follow these steps to build the LP TIMER application using the Alif Zephyr SDK:

1. For instructions on fetching the Alif Zephyr SDK and navigating to the Zephyr repository, please refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_


.. note::
   The build commands shown here are specifically for the Alif E7 DevKit.
   To build the application for other boards, modify the board name in the build command accordingly. For more information, refer to the `ZAS User Guide`_, under the section Setting Up and Building Zephyr Applications.


2. Build commands for applications on the M55 HP core:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_hp samples/drivers/counter/alarm/ -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=boards/alif_lptimer.overlay

3. Build commands for applications on the M55 HE core:

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b alif_e7_dk/ae722f80f55d5xx/rtss_he samples/drivers/counter/alarm/ -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=boards/alif_lptimer.overlay


Once the build command completes successfully, executable images will be generated and placed in the `build/zephyr` directory. Both `.bin` (binary) and `.elf` (Executable and Linkable Format) files will be available.

Executing Binary on the DevKit
==============================================

To execute binaries on the DevKit follow the command

.. code-block:: bash

   west flash
