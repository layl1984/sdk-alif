GT911 Touchscreen
=================

Introduction
============

The GT911 is a sophisticated 5-point capacitive touch solution tailored for 7" to 8" Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs). It features up to 26 transmitter electrodes and 14 receiver electrodes, which work together to enhance touch accuracy. The controller supports up to 5 concurrent touches, providing real-time tracking of touch position, motion trajectory, and touch area. It efficiently reports this information to the host system when required.

   GT911 Internal Diagram

The GT911 interfaces with the host through six key pins: VDD, GND, SCL, SDA, INT, and RESET. The INT pin can be triggered by a rising or falling edge, and when set as an input, it should remain floating with no internal pull-up or pull-down. The host controls the RESET pin by outputting high or low levels, with a recommendation to keep the RESET signal low for more than 100 microseconds for a reliable reset.

Communication with the host occurs via a standard I2C interface, with a maximum transmission rate of 400K bps. For communication speeds exceeding 200K bps, it's crucial to select an appropriate resistance for the external pull-up resistor on the I2C lines to ensure sharp signal edges on SCL and SDA. As a slave device, the GT911 uses a 7-bit address for identification, complemented by a Read/Write control bit, supporting two slave addresses:

   * - 7-bit Address
     - 8-bit Write Address
     - 8-bit Read Address
   * - 0x5D
     - 0xBA
     - 0xBB
   * - 0x14
     - 0x28
     - 0x29

After each power-on or reset, the I2C address must be set via the INT pin, ensuring proper communication setup.

The GT911 touch controller is designed to deliver high precision and reliability for touch-based interfaces in MIDs, with straightforward integration into systems via I2C. Its robust performance and multi-touch capabilities make it an excellent choice for enhancing user interaction in various applications.

.. table:: GPIO and I2C Pin Configurations for GT911 Touchscreen Controller

   +----------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+
   | Configuration              | GPIO Pin | Function                         |
   +============================+==========+==================================+
   | GT911 GPIO (B0 Flat Board) | P4_0     | Touch Interrupt Signal           |
   +----------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+
   | GT911 GPIO (B0 Flat Board) | P9_4     | Touch Reset Signal               |
   +----------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+
   | I2C GPIO                   | P7_2     | I2C1_SDA_C (Data Line)           |
   +----------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+
   | I2C GPIO                   | P7_3     | I2C1_SCL_C (Clock Line)          |
   +----------------------------+----------+----------------------------------+

These configurations indicate how the GPIO pins and I2C communication lines are set up for the device to work correctly. The I2C lines from the I2C1 instance are internally connected to the touch sensor, and hence, additional external connections are not required.
